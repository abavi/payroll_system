# payroll_system
## This is the first coursework for the OOP Module in my first year of university. It's a console based payroll system where the user can add, view, remove employees and also generate payslips or see previous ones.

### I have used basic Git commands to commit changes and push them to the GitHub repo.

### Core concepts the program focused on:
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism  
- Encapsulation  
- Abstracion

### Other concepts I had to learn:
- Working with lists
- User input
- Creating console menus
