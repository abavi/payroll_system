# payroll_system
This is the first coursework for the OOP Module in my first year of university. It's a console based payroll system where the user can add, view, remove employees and also generate payslips or see previous ones.

Core concepts the program focused on:
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstracion

I have also used basic Git commands to commit changes and push them to the GitHub repo.

TODO:
    - Validation Checks
    - Refactor code
    - Add a proper GUI
